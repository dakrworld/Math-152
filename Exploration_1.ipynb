        "Our first task is to check the Collatz conjecture for all positive integers up to a big number. That is, we need to show that the sequence produced by applying the Collatz algorithm to any positive integer between, say, 1 and 1000000 will eventually reach the cycle 4,2,1,4,2,1,....\n",
        "\n",
        "Initially, one might have the thought that the best approach to take is to, for each intger one wishes to check, print the sequence and then manually verify that, past a certain point, all one sees is 4,2,1 repeated over and over again. There is, however, a better way. We know that, for 4, 2, and 1, the Collatz algorithm generates, as the first term in the sequence, 2, 1, and 4, respectively. What this means is that when 4 makes its first appearance in the sequence, the cylcle 2,1,4,2,1,...is guarenteed to follow. Thus, we don't need to show that the sequence eventually reaches the cycle 4,2,1,4,2,1,...; we just need to show that the sequence gives rise to a 4 (or a 2 or a 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "There are various ways to do this. Obviously, we can code a function that takes as its input the value of n we wish to verify the conjecture for and, for its output, prints terms of the sequence until a 4 arises. This, in theory, works. If terms stop getting printed, then the conjecture holds; if they don't, then it doesn't. But is it really necessary to print each term? In this case, it isn't. Printing is a demanding, time consuming process that, if possible, should be avoided. Since we're only really interested in showing that a 4 pops up at some point, there isn't any need for the other terms of the sequence to be printed; we don't even need to print the 4. We just need a function of positive integers that internally runs through the terms of the sequence, and returns true when it lands on 4. \n",
        "\n",
        "This, it appears, is the best approach to take. We just need to be careful to make sure that 4 arises out of a consideration of each term of the sequence, not some other process. In other words, we need to be certain that out function is (a) looking at the terms of the sequence and (b) returning true only when it finds a 4. \n",

        "It takes, as its input, a positive integer n. The first thing that happens next is another function is defined. This function returns the smallest integer not less than half of n (why we need this value will become clear). Then we have a while loop. It perpetuates as long as n is not equal to 4. First, it checks if n is even. (It does this by integer(n) is equal to one half of n: integer(n) is the smallest integer not less than half of n. Clearly, if n is an even number, this number is equal to one half of n; if, however, it is odd, it is not, for one half of an odd number is not an integer. Thus, checking that integer(n) is equal to one half of n is a valid way of determining the parity of n.) If it is, n is, accordingly, set to one half n. It, however, it is determined that n is not even, then n must be odd, in which case n is, as the Collatz conjecture dictates, set to three times n plus 1.  \n",
